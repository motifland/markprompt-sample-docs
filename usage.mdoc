## Usage

Currently, the Markprompt API has basic protection against misuse when making requests from public websites, such as rate limiting, IP blacklisting, allowed origins, and prompt moderation. These are not strong guarantees against misuse though, and it is always safer to expose an API like Markprompt's to authenticated users, and/or in non-public systems using private access tokens. We do plan to offer more extensive tooling on that front (hard limits, spike protection, notifications, query analysis, flagging).
